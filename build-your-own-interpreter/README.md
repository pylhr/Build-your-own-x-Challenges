# Build Your Own Interpreter

This is my solution to the !(Build-Your-Own-Interpreter)[https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter] challenge by codecrafters.

This challenge is based on !(Crafting Interpreters)[https://craftinginterpreters.com/] book by Robert Nystorm.
Learnings from this challenge : 
- Tokenization
- ASTs
- Tree-walk interpreters
